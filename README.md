# Password_W_GUI
This is a very simple, very straight_foward mini-app that i created, it has a GUI and it allows to store your passwords in an file of your choice, it has a built in password genetator and it will generate non-compiling break errors because of the exceptions( if you insert a password but not an e-mail, for example.)
